# Data Analysis with R (Udacity)

This repo contains my solution to the Udacity course "Data Analysis with R" which can be found [here](https://eg.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651). This course is about 2 months long and is supported by Facebook corporation. 

Exploratory data analysis is an approach for summarizing and visualizing the important characteristics of a data set. EDA focuses on exploring data to understand the dataâ€™s underlying structure and variables, to develop intuition about the data set, to consider how that data set came into existence, and to decide how it can be investigated with more formal statistical methods.



## Note
